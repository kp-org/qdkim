// This file is an intermediary which chooses the correct resolver
// to use based on the platform
//
// Windows 2k+ -> Dynamically load dnsapi.dll and use DnsQuery()
// Win9x/NT    -> Use dnsresolv.cpp
// UNIX        -> Use res_query from libresolv
//
// These DNS resolution routines are encapsulated by the API below

// return values for DNS functions:

#define MAX_DOMAIN 254

#define DNSRESP_SUCCESS                 0   // DNS lookup returned sought after records
#define DNSRESP_TEMP_FAIL               1   // No response from DNS server
#define DNSRESP_PERM_FAIL               2   // DNS server returned error or no records
#define DNSRESP_DOMAIN_NAME_TOO_LONG    3   // Domain name too long
#define DNSRESP_NXDOMAIN                4   // DNS server returned Name Error
#define DNSRESP_EMPTY                   5   // DNS server returned successful response but no records

// Pass in the FQDN to get the TXT record
int DNSGetTXT( const char *szFQDN, char* Buffer, int nBufLen );
