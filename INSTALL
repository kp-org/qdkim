# qdkim - install

Requirements

libqdim needs openssl >0.9.8, recommended is >1.0.1r. It is recommended
to use GNU gcc (g++) 4.8 or newer to compile the source.

  - an existing *qmail installation (e.g. in /var/qmail)
  - bourne shell (/bin/sh) or a full compatible shell
  - g++ (gcc)

Installation

Download sources and extract it. Change into the source folder and
check/edit conf-home. Then run:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install

Everything will be installed inside the existing QMAILHOME.

Configuration

0. stop *qmail
1. Verification with qmail-vdkim
   - set QMAILQUEUE=QMAILHOME/bin/qmail-vdkim
2. Signing with qmail-sdkim
   a) mv qmail-remote qmail-remote.bin
   b) ln -s qmail-sdkim qmail-remote
     --> this is the 'classic' way (better: use qmail-bfrmt)
   c) run mkdkimkeys to create a domainkey and publish it in DNS
3. in 'QMAILHOME/{etc/control}/qdkim.conf set:
   DOVRFY=1
   DOSIGN=1
   QMAILREMOTE=QMAILHOME/bin/qmail-remote.bin
4. start *qmail


* libqdkim was tested to run on Linux-like systems only.
  - Gentoo linux
  - Debian 7 "Wheezy"
  - openSuSE 13.2
 (- FreeBSD 10.2   --> really? couldn't remember)
